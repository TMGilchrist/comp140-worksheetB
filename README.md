## Game Proposal

### Overview
A 2D space flight simulator using top down "strafe and shoot" style game where you are pitted against waves of enemies in the bleak expanse of space.
Although the game is fairly conventional in its mechanical design, the controller input will be the unique selling point of the game.   

### Core Mechanics

### Input  
* Top down shooter.  
* Two axis of movement, forward and sideways, that can be combined for diagonal movement. Movement should be smooth and responsive. 
* A weapon that can be aimed independently of the ship movement. 360 degrees of aiming  

### Player resources  
* Limited health bar protected by recharging shields.
* Shield boost ability to quickly restore shields.

### Enemies  
* At least two enemy types.
* Enemies should spawn in roughly defined waves with short periods in between where shields can recharge and the player can take a breath.

### Possible Alternative
* Two player co-op in which one chair controls the ship movement and another chair controls the weapon aiming. 
* Could be scaled up for multiple weapons.

## Controller Proposal
The Impractical and Dangerous Chair Joystick MK1

A computer chair (must have forward/backwards tilt, rotation, back adjustment) will act as the controller.  

* Forwards/backwards tilt will control forwards/backwards movement.
* Spinning the chair will control sideways movement.
* Some form of thumbstick for 360 degree aiming and shooting. (Possible alternative below)
* Back adjustment used to engage shield boost.
* It will probably require at least one accelerometer.

### Alternatives
* Alternative co-op would use a second chair to control the weapons aiming and firing. The weapon chairs would need a way to see the screen while spinning.
* Arm-rests controls to strafe? Spin chair 360 degrees to dodge.
